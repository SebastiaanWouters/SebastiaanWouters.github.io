            <p>If you haven't been living under a rock for the past 11 years, you've probably heard about Bitcoin a few times right now.
             <b style="color:white"><br><br> "It's Magic Internet Money"
             <br> "It's Money For Criminals"
             <br> "It's wasting all our energy"
             <br> "It's going to zero" 
             <br> "It's a Ponzi Scheme" <br> <br></b>
             That's what most people would answer if they got asked about Bitcoin.
             All these answers sound very negative and mysterious. The reason for this is that most people don't have a clue what Bitcoin is. They hear about in the news and make up their mind, without doing their own research. They assume that the media is always right, because why wouldn't they? Let me tell you something: All these famous tv anchors and reporters don't have any idea either what Bitcoin is all about. 
             Their mission is to generate views and clicks. Actually telling the truth rarely increases the amount of clicks they get, so they don't bother doing it.
             <br><br>Luckily there exist some very sincere and knowledgeable people on the internet, from whom i've been learning about Bitcoin for the past 2 years. These people are heavily invested in Bitcoin, so they are financially incentivized to understand what it is. With this website I want to formulate a better and more truthful
             answer to the question: "What Is Bitcoin?" 
             After reading the page, I hope you'll start to have an understanding of why it is that Bitcoin is such a big deal.<br> 
             <br><b> It's time you wake up, and discover Bitcoin, because it's f*cking cool! </b>

            <h1>Bitcoin is Better Money</h1>
            <p>Money is one part of every transaction. Everyone uses money on a daily basis, yet only a few people have asked themselves: "What is Money?"
                <br><br>We spend most of our time and energy at work, in exchange for money at the end of each month. When you think about it in this way, money is just a way of storing energy and time. 

                <br>Anything that's scarce and hard to produce is valuable to us. Our mother and father are so important to us, because we only have one of each. That necklace you received from your grandma ten years ago is so precious to you, because it is unique. The air you breathe is free, because it is abundant. But when you're drowning in a pool, suddenly a little bit of air becomes priceless. It becomes clear very quicky that <b>scarcity equals value</b>. 
                
                <br><br>What's one thing that nobody can create more of, yet everyone wants more of? It's time. Time is the scarcest asset we know of today. No matter how much money someone has, It is impossible to live forever. Everyone  has a limited set of days on this earth. If we could buy an extra year of life, the price of this year would be unimaginably high.
                
                <br><br>When you are working, you're essentially trading your valuable and limited time for money. This money used to be backed by gold, meaning there was a limit on how much could be created. Back then you were trading two scarce items, which makes sense. But these days, money is backed by nothing and can be created out of thin air by governments and central banks all over the world. Increasing the money supply, deminishes the value that each individual unit of that money represents. So by printing more money, it's value is decreasing.  As you're storing your time and energy in this money, <b>central banks are essentially stealing your time and effort.</b>
                <br><br> <img class="textimage" src="images/dollarvalue.png">
                
                <br><br>In essence, we are trading our time, which is strictly limited, for a money that can be printed out of thin air with no cost or effort. Does this seem like a good deal?  I don't think so. This is where people started looking for alternatives.
                
                <br>People are looking for assets that are costly to create, so they can be sure their part of the total wealth stored in this asset remains about the same. Three obvious options that possess this 'unforgeable costliness' are real estate and stocks. It is no wonder that since the activation of the money printer a lot of value started flowing into these assets, as these are two of the very few options to protect your wealth.
                <br><br><img class="textimage" src="images/homeprices.png"><img class="textimage" src="images/sp500.png">
                <br><br>
                A lot of people have benifited greatly from this, but it is not for everyone. The majority of the world population can't afford a house or don't have the knowledge/time to become an expert in the stock market. 
                <br><br>These people need another alternative. 
                <br><b>These people need Bitcoin, they just don't know it yet.</b>
                <br><br>Bitcoin is often called digital gold, because for both, mining is the only way to increase its supply. But when you compare gold and Bitcoin, the winner is clear. 
                <br><br>Every year, the supply of gold increases by about 2 percent. But what if the price of gold started ricing exponentially? A lot of new mining businesses would be created, driving up the supply, diminishing the value of each unit of gold. What if we discovered a way to mine the seabottom for gold, or other planets? Gold would lose a big part of it's scarcity, and your stored time and energy would lose a big part of its value. 
                <br><br>With Bitcoin, the scarcity is set in stone. There will never be more then 21 million bitcoins, it's just not gonna happen. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, made this possible by using a beautiful mechanism: "The Difficuilty Adjustment". As more and more miners enter the space, you would expect the supply growth to increase, as with gold. As miners turned off their machines, you would expect the supply growth to decrease, as with gold. Well, you couldn't be more wrong. Due to the difficulty adjustment, the amount of new bitcoins issued every day is indifferent to the amount of miners. It just becomes more difficuilt or more easy to mine new units, depending on the amount of active miners.
                <br><br>As a bonus feature, every four years, the amount of bitcoin that gets added to the supply everyday is cut in half. This event is called "The Halving", it will take place until the amount cannot be divided anymore. At this moment, somewhere around 2140, the supply will have reached the magical amount of 21 million. Bitcoin is as scarce as time, because they are the only two assets on this planet with a fixed supply.
                <br><br> <img class="textimage" src="images/bitcoin-inflation-chart.png">
                <br><br>
                <br>By now, I hope you understand that money is a way of storing your time. Your time is scarce, and therefore valuable. Not even Billionaires like Steve Jobs were able to buy themselves extra time, because it is priceless. When you go to work, you're exchanging money for time. You are trading your most valuable asset, your time, for something that can be created out of thin air at absolutely no cost. More and more people started to realize that this trade is not fair. They were being robbed of their time.
                As a consequence, the money started flowing into scarce assets like stocks, real estate and gold. Unfortunately these assets are not for everyone, they have their downfalls, and they are not as limited in supply as time. This is why Bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin is the best storage mechanism for your limited time. 
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin has a fixed supply.</b>
                <br><br><b>Because your part of the total wealth will remain stable over time.</b> 
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin is for everyone.</b>

            <h1 class="big">Bitcoin is a Human Right</h1>
            <p>Throughout the last decade, the internet has become part of our daily lives. Most of our actions are somehow connected to an app or website, accessible through the cloud. Every action generates a tiny bit of information about us that will be stored on a central server for years to come. As time passes, these tiny bits of information turn in to one giant pile of personal data that is stored on computers all over the world.
            <br><br>As people realised that all this data could be used to control us and spy on us, they started caring more about it. All over the world, people started deleting their facebook account, enctypting their messages and overall reducing the amount of personal data they left on the internet. 
            <br><br>It's clear that in general, people are very concerned about their online privacy. As they should be, because privacy is a human right. As we further digitize our world, money is becoming more and more digital as well. In countries like Sweden and China the use of cash is almost non existent, almost all payments are made with a smartphone and are thus digital.
            As a result, all of our transactions are now stored on some server or computer somewhere on earth. This collection of transactions is our financial data. As concerned as people are about their online data, as clueless they are about their online financial data. Yet this data contains a lot of information about you. It can reveal what you are interested in, where you are going and when you are shopping. In contrast to our other data, we seem to have no problem handing over
            our financial information to banks and payment processors. 
            <br><br><img class="textimageSmall"src="images/cashless2.jpg">
            <br><br>Digital files can be copied and send to different people multiple times. The same is true for digital money, so we need these third parties that act as a referee to make sure that you can only spend your money once. Third parties provide security while taking away your privacy. When satoshi presented Bitcoin to the world, he provided us with a solution to this problem.
            <br><br>Bitcoin is the invention of digital scarcity. This means that it allows digital money to work without requiring trust in banks as a referee. This trust has been broken too many times.
            <br><br> <i>"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work."</i>
            <br>Satoshi Nakamoto
            <br><br> <b>Bitcoin enables digital money while preserving our privacy.</b>
            <br><br>In its current form, Bitcoin isn't always as private as you might want it to be. But at least it gives us the framework on which private digital money can be enabled. The last few years developers have made a lot of progress towards that goal.
            We're moving into a cashless society, that's inevitable. If it wasn't for Bitcoin, a society like this wouldn't be possible without giving up our privacy. One of our human rights would get taken away for the sake of "progress".
            <br><br>China is a perfect example of how it can go wrong. They have already achieved this cashless society, but not through Bitcoin. All the payments in China are made with their national superapp "Wechat". The enormous amount of data that's gathered in this app is directly available to the chinese government. This has enabled them to implement a social credit system throughout the country with which they control their citizens.
            You're constantly being monitored and one misstep can restrict your access to jobs, loans, insurance and freedom. 
            <br><br><img class="textimageSmall" src="images/socialcredit.jpg">
            <br><br>A cashless society doesn't have to look like the one in china. Bitcoin gives us an alternative future in which our right to privacy is protected.

            <h1 class="big">Bitcoin Is a Measuring Stick</h1>
            <p>An economy is a very complex system of interactions between buyers and sellers. Buyers get information from sellers and sellers get information from buyers. This information is presented to them not in words, but in prices. The price of a good determines how much a producer is willing to produce and how much a consumer is willing to consume. But don't get fooled, prices are not only influencing market decisions, this mechanism also works in the opposite direction. Decisions are shaping prices. Prices are an aggregate of all known market information. If demand for a certain good goes up, it's price will follow as more and more money flows towards the good. This results in less money flowing into other products, eventually lowering the prices of these products. Prices are a tool that enables businesses and humans in general to allocate their resources in the most efficient manner.
            <br><br>In the famous piece "I, Pencil", Leonard E. Read beautifully highlights how no single person on earth is capable  of producing a pencil on his own. if you think about it, this makes sense. A lot of resources and cooperation is needed to complete even the simplest of products:
            <br><br>Wood from the trees
            <br>A saw to gather the wood
            <br>Rubber for the eraser, found in the tropics
            <br>Graphite, from the mines in South-America
            <br>Paint to complete the design 
            <br>...
            
            <br><br>

            All these building blocks need to be produced, processed and finally put together to form a pencil. All the cooperation that was needed to complete this complex process was not centrally planned. It is not possible for one single entity to dictate how to allocate resources at every step of the process. Rather this collaboration is made possible by the information contained in the prices of all the needed components.
            There are a lot of companies involved in delivering the necessary components for the pencil. Every single one of these companies uses the price, which is an aggregate of the markets preferences, to deploy its capital in the most efficient way.
            <br><br>By now it should be clear how vital of a role that prices play in the economy, and how no single entity could gather enough information to centrally plan the economy. This task is much better handled by a free and organic system of prices. This is were our money fucks up everything, prices are not free nor organic. Prices should perfectly represent supply and demand, going up when demand increases or supply decreases, going down when supply increases or demand decreases. But in reality, prices are distorted by central banks because they have complete power over
            the money printer. The supply of money can be increased and decreased (although this rarely happens) as they wish. What's the modern solution for a recession? Print Money. What to do when inefficient companies go broke? Print Money. It is believed that by printing money the economy can be saved, without considering the way this distorts our pricing system.
            <br><br>When the supply of money changes, so do our prices. When you increase the amount of something, it's value decreases, as explained in previous sections. Prices of products and services are expressed in a currency with a varying supply. As a consequence these prices no longer reflect the preferences of the market, but become rather a function of how much the money supply is being manipulated.
            <br><br>
            Coordination between companies is based on the information provided by these prices, but as this information gets tampered with, the cooperation relying on it breaks down. Imagine a good with a very stable supply and demand, in normal circumstances the price of this good would be stable and businesses could allocate their capital based on it.  But now what happens when the money supply gets artificially inflated? The price goes up, signalling an increase in demand to the producers, causing them to ramp up production. This will result in a surplus of the good, which lowers the profits the company in question makes. The problem with this should be clear: There never was an actual increase in demand, however through the manipulation of the money supply just it seemed like there was. 
            As all prices in our economy are denominated in the same manipulated currency, all market information loses its meaning. As companies lose the signals they need in order to allocate their resources efficiently, everything starts falling apart. 
            <br><br>In most parts of the world, like Europe and America, the money supply is increased at a relatively slow pace. This doesn't distort the price signals significantly in the short term. But if you take a look at countries like Venezuela, it becomes clear how important a stable money supply is. Even though they are blessed with huge amounts of natural resources, their economy has completely collapsed since the government started printing money at an astronomical pace. Shelves all across the country are empty and people are starving, all because efficient coordination between suppliers and producers is not possible anymore.
            You should be aware, because this can happen in every country where government controls the money supply, yours included.
            <br><br><img class="textimageSmall"src="images/emptyshelves.jpg">
            <br><br>This is where Bitcoin comes to the rescue. As you have come to understand by now, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million units. This means that nobody can manipulate it, essentialy providing us with prices that cannot be manipuated, assuming that Bitcoin was used a Unit Of Account.If you think about it, using a currency of which the supply constantly changes is like using a ruler of which the length constantly changes. It's impossible to do efficient claculations with it because you cannot compare measurements through time. Imagine building a house with such a ruler, it wouldn't be easy!
            This is exactly the reason why we have invented standardized measurement units for weight, length, time, temperature ... 
            <br><br><img class="textimageSmallNoBorder" src="images/si_units.png">
            <br><br>Wouldn't it be logical to have a stable measuring stick for value? Yes it would be, but since our currencies have been manipulated for such a long time, we have forgotten how useful this can be. 
            <br><br><b>This is why we need Bitcoin </b>
            <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin enables the most efficient allocation of resources</b>
            <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin is a measuring stick for value</b>

            <h1 class="big">Bitcoin Is The Currency Of The Internet</h1>
            <p> As Technology is evolving exponentially, the world is becoming more and more connected. The internet acts as a second reality for a lot of younger people. It enables us to chat with friends, watch our favourite tv series, attend zoom meetings for work, play  games, consume the news, and so much more. Data has become digital and therefore it can now be transferred instantly to anywhere in the world. This is enabling a much more productive and convenient life for many of us.  
                <br><br>
                I want you to think about something: Why is it that i can stream a video directly to the other side of the planet with almost no latency or cost, yet when I try to do the same thing with money it takes "3-5 business days" and costs me 5% in fees. This doesn't make sense, and the only reason this evolution hasn't taken place for money is that banks have created a monopoly over it. They want to maintain the current system because otherwise they would lose their grip over society. In the process of protecting their power they are killing all the innovations in the money space. For a long time they have succeeded to do so, but in 2009 they were finally defeated. Bitcoin was released, and eleven years later they still have not managed to
                stop it. This is because Bitcoin cannot be killed.

                Bitcoin will make possible the same things for money that the internet made possible for data. It allows you to send any amount of money to any person on earth, not caring about location, age, gender, sex or anything else. Sending money will become as easy as sending a text message. Bitcoin will also allow microtransactions over the internet. 
                Back in the days people communicated over the internet primairily using mail. They would only send a couple of mails a day, containing as much information as possible. Today the way we communicate online has been totally changed, the average person probably sends more then 100 messages every day sometimes only containing a few characters or emojis. Online communication has become a constant stream of messages. Bitcoin will change the way we send money the same way the internet changed communication.
                <br><br>Paying for netflix won't be a monthly subscription anymore, instead of this, a stream of money will start flowing in to the wallet of Netflix as soon as you start watching your favourite tv show. The moment you decide to stop watching, the stream will be stopped. Monthly subscriptions for digital content will be replaced by streams of money that get initiated as you start consuming.

                <br><br>Gaming is becoming a bigger part of our lives, especially within the younger generations. As we know, It is very common for games to allow you to buy a certain "in game currency" with which you can buy items, skins, weapons in the game itself. The problem with these "game coins" is that every game uses different coins that are not compatible with each other. Although putting real money into a game may be quite easy, converting the "in game currency" back to real life currency is almost never possible. But you've guessed it, Bitcoin changes this too. Bitcoin can be the unique currency that is used in all games. The difference between "in game currency" and "real life currency" would disappear completely. 
                This would allow players to withdraw their game tokens with ease and directly transfer them into another game or use them in a shop or restaurant. Whilst e-sports is already evolving rapidly into one of the most lucrative industries in the world, Bitcoin could accelarate this evolution even more. 
                <br><br>The internet has evolved the way we distribute and consume data. As long as you have a smartphone and an internet connection all the data in the world is available right at your fingertips. This data is delivered to you in real-time with no cost.
                Money has not yet gone through this transformation, because banks don't allow it too. But thanks to Bitcoin it will be possible to stream money over the internet just as we stream video today. The implications of this revolutionary concept are too groundbreaking to imagine, just as no single person could have predicted how the internet was going to change the way we transfer information. 
                <br><b>Bitcoin is the logical next step in the digitalisation of the world</b>
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin was born on the internet</b>
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin allows us to stream money just as we stream data</b>
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin is the internet of money</b>
